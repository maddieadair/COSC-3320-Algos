P15) Recursive Method to Traverse Staircase

You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the maximum number of steps that you can advance up the staircase at a time. 
Write a function that returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.

For example, if you were given a staircase of height = 3 and maxSteps = 2 you could climb the staircase in 3 ways. 
You could take 1 step, 1 step, then 1 step, you could also take 1 step, then 2 steps, and you could take 2 steps, then 1 step.

Input format:
height = [The height of the staircase]
maxSteps = [The maximum number of steps you can take at a time]

Examples

Input:
4
2
Output:
5

-----------------------------

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int combinations(int height, int maxSteps) {
  if (height == 1 || height == 0) {
    return 1;
  }

  else if (height <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  int count = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= maxSteps; i++) {
    count += combinations(height - i, maxSteps);
  }
  return count;
}

int main() {

  int height;
  int maxSteps;

  cin >> height >> maxSteps;

  cout << combinations(height, maxSteps);

  return 0;
}
